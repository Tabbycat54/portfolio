        <h1> The Mean Kitties </h1>
        <p> Ever so often, you come across a cat that is mean. You could swear they were the meanest of mean kitties. Let me tell you a little story of the meanest kitties I've ever had.</p>
        <p> In September, we lost our big loveable cat, Gypsy. Here he is with Chie, our black panther.</p>
        <img src="../assets/images/Gypsy.jpg" alt="Chie and Gypsy" width="300">
        <p> That same day, I saw a notification on Facebook from a woman that I had known since I was five.</p>
        <img src="../assets/images/The beginning.jpg" alt="The Beginning" width="300">
        <p> Believe it or not, for almost two weeks, I said no. I was honestly too busy and grieving, but after two weeks, they were still there. We called them up and said, "We'll take them." </p>
        <p> And so it began. We named the torty up there "Naoto" and the big tabby "Klarth". For nearly three months, they hid under the office in the garage. But then, one day.</p>
        <img src="../assets/images/The Mean Kitties.jpg" alt="Two big cats and a kitten" width="300">
        <p> Meet these so called "mean kitties" who turned out to be the best kitties in the world. Naoto and Klarth sit with me everyday as I write and code. Even my clients know them both because they have to say hello.</p>
        <p> The moral of the story is that you should never judge a cat by its initial hiss or swipe. They may turn out to be a developer's best friend. </p>
        <p> If you want to see a real mean kitty though, meet Locke, master of the kitty thug life!!</p>
