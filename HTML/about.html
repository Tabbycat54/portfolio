    <main>
    <p> Hello there! My name is Tabitha, but most everyone knows me as Tabbycat54. I am a game master, gamer, Twitch Streamer, 
    writer, Jazz musician and a Jill of all trades. I have been in many different roles, and I wear a lot of hats. At the end of the day I
    am just a girl who loves to create and explore new ideas.</p>

    <p> Apart from being all of these things, I'm also a pet mom with way way way too many cats and a couple of dogs. I am indeed
    a crazy cat lady, and I embrace it fully! When I'm not busy creating content, gaming, coding, or working, you can find me spoiling my fur
    babies and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. </p>

    <p> The biggest hat that I wear is that of a mental health professional. I work with teenagers, and it is the most fulfilling role I've ever had.
    I have been in customer service and retail, working with electronics, TV, and internet. I have been in food service as a delivery driver, cook,
    and food lead. I have been a social worker, and let me tell you, that's not for me. I have found my true calling as a Case Manager, and I am in 
    school now to get a second Master's Degree in Counseling so that I can become a Licensed Professional Counselor. Second you may ask? Yes, I have
    a Master's Degree in Criminal Justice already, but I found that my passion lies in helping people on a more personal level. I also have two Bachelor's
    Degrees, one in Psychology and another in Music. I even have two minors in Sociology and Criminal Justice. I currently have certifications in Case Management, 
    Wellness Coaching, and Python Programming. I love to learn and grow, and I believe that education is a lifelong journey.  </p>

    <p> I created this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects in web development and coding. I am excited to share my work with you
    and hope that you find it interesting and engaging. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
