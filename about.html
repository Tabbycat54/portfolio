        <p class="about"> Hello there! My name is Tabitha, but most everyone knows me as Tabbycat54. I am a game master, gamer, Twitch Streamer, 
        writer, Jazz musician and a Jill of all trades. I have been in many different roles, and I wear a lot of hats. At the end of the day I
        am just a girl who loves to create and explore new ideas.</p>
        <p class="about"> Apart from being all of these things, I'm also a pet mom with way way way too many cats and a couple of dogs. I am indeed
        a crazy cat lady, and I embrace it fully! When I'm not busy creating content, gaming, coding, or working, you can find me spoiling my fur
        babies and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. </p>
        <p class="about"> The biggest hat that I wear is that of a mental health professional. I work with teenagers, and it is the most fulfilling role I've ever had.
        I have been in customer service and retail, working with electronics, TV, and internet. I have been in food service as a delivery driver, cook,
        and food lead. I have been a social worker, and let me tell you, that's not for me. I have found my true calling as a Case Manager, and I am in 
        school now to get a second Master's Degree in Counseling so that I can become a Licensed Professional Counselor. </p> 
        <p class="about"> Second you may ask? Yes, I have a Master's Degree in Criminal Justice already, but I found that my passion lies in helping people on a more personal level. I also have two Bachelor's
        Degrees, one in Psychology and another in Music. I even have two minors in Sociology and Criminal Justice. I currently have certifications in Case Management, 
        Wellness Coaching, and Python. I love to learn and grow, and I believe that education is a lifelong journey.  </p>
        <p class="about"> I created this portfolio as part of a course, but I continue to update it so that I can continue to practice my skills. As I learn more pages may get shifted and added, 
        so feel free to come back anytime. Even after my coursework is complete, I intend on continuing to update this portfolio to showcase what I can do. Everything is documented to show 
        where we started and how far we've come. Thank you for coming with me on my journey into insanity.</p>
